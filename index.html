  <h2>What is Djent?</h2>
  <br>

  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>Djent (/dʒɛnt/) (also known as Djent metal) is a subgenre of progressive metal.
    <br>
    Its distinctive sound is a high-gain, distorted, palm-muted, low-pitch guitar sound. The name "Djent" is an
    onomatopoeia of this sound.

  <h3>Origins</h3>
  <p>
    Djent is first heard on Meshuggah's second album <i>Destroy Erase Improve</i> in 1995. But how did they come up with
    the name and sound?
    <br>
    Mårten Hagström, a band member, shared the following story:
    <br>
    <blockquote cite="https://www.revolvermag.com/music/meshuggah-apologize-djent-it-was-drunk-misunderstanding">
      <i>
        "First of all, we're very sorry for creating that genre. We didn't intend to — our bad. I think it's a
        misconception, that djent thing."
      </i>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote cite="https://www.revolvermag.com/music/meshuggah-apologize-djent-it-was-drunk-misunderstanding">
      "It was our lead guitar player, Fredrik, being drunk back in the day, talking to one of our old-school fans,
      trying to explain what type of guitar tone we were always trying to get,
      and he was desperately trying to say: <br>

      <i>
        'We want that 'dj—' 'dj—,' 'dj—,' 'dj—,'
      </i>

      Hagström explained, imitating a riff. "And that guy was, like,
      <i>
        'What's he saying? Is that a Swedish word? Must be.
        Sounds like dj_, maybe 'djent'? Maybe something like that.'"
      </i>
      <br>
      <br>
      "And that's where it comes from: a drunk misunderstanding, as always, with Meshuggah."
    </blockquote>
