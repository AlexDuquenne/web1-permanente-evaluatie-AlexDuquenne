                <h3>Top 5: League Of Legends</h3>
                <img src="./img/League-of-Legends.jpg" alt="League-of-Legends image">
                <p>
                    Who hasn't heard of League of Legends, the most played free to play MOBA (Multiplayer Online Batte Arena) game on the market. 
                    This easy to learn but hard to master competitive game offers a large variety of champions to take on the typical three-laned battle arena.
                    Each year they release a new season with major changes like adding new items or balancing and reworking champions and
                    Every month or so they add a new playable character with unique spell sets and cosmetics
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I started playing this game around 2012 and can't stop playing it. Each season I try to play and master a different champion or position to improve my general skills and take those freshly-learned skills to ranked games.
                    I love the game on itself, but the community isn't the best, people tend to take League of Legends too seriously and will insult you for every little missplay. 
                    That's why I would recommend to only play this game with friends and with the chat muted.

                <h3>Top 4: Onward</h3>
                <img src="./img/onward.jpg" alt="VR mil-sim onward">
                <p>
                    Onward is a First Person military simulator built for Virtual Reality. The Multiplayer is really immersive but hard! One or two bullets and you're dead, so don't miss your shots!
                    For a better experience play with friends.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I love playing airsoft with my friends, but due to the corona-pandemic this isn't really possible anymore. 
                    That's why I recently picked this game up and had a blast playing it (even if I found it quite difficult to learn at first)

                <h3>Top 3: Assetto Corsa</h3>
                <img src="./img/ac.jpg" alt="racing-sim Assetto Corsa">
                <p>
                    Assetto Corsa is a racing simulator but also a more sandbox-y game that allows modding. This sim can be played with a Virtual Reality headset and a racing wheel and pedals!
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This is by far my favourite racing game. The game on itself isn't that special nor unique but the mods make this the most complete racing game one might ask.
                    I haven't a driver licence myself but I'm sure this game could help me get it. The driving is realistic, the accidents are scary and the racing and drifting is incredibly satisifying.
                    Pair this game with a VR headset, a racing wheel with pedals and an H-shifter and you won't see me for the next 5 hours!

                <h3>Top 2: Battlefield 3</h3>
                <img src="./img/bf3.jpg" alt="arcade FPS Battlefield 3">
                <p>
                    Battlefield or Call Of Duty? Battlefield is a first person shooter with a campaign and large Multiplayer mode. In Multiplayer you can choose between 4 classes; Assault, Engineer, Support or Recon. 
                    Each class have their own weapons and equipements. The maps are big enough for the 64 - 128 players and the buildings are destroyable. Isn't this perfect?
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I've played this game for years, trying to get each class to its max level, trying to do sick shots like jumping of a plane and destroying a motorbike with a rocket launcher - while parachuting.
                    No other FPS game is as satisifying as this one and lets you do those kinda things.

            <div class="rev5">
                <h3>Top 1: Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</h3>
                <img src="./img/csgo.jpg" alt="Competitive FPS Counter-Strike: Global Offensive">
                <p>
                    And last but not least, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, a competitive FPS game that asks a lot of skill from the player. 
                    This game isn't easy to pick up but when you do, it's really, really amazing.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This isn't my first game from the franchise, but it's the one I always go back to. I've spent hours and hours trying to learn each unique gun recoil pattern, each map and all the callouts they have.
